What is SocketIO Room
===
Socket.IO rooms are a concept that allows you to group connected clients into separate channels or rooms. This allows you to send messages or events to a specific group of clients instead of broadcasting to all connected clients

In Socket.IO, you can create and manage rooms on both the server-side and client-side. Clients can join or leave rooms, and the server can send events to clients within a specific room.


Features
================================
Socket.IO rooms provide several features and benefits for managing and organizing communication within your Socket.IO application. Here are some key features of Socket.IO rooms:

1. Grouping Clients: Rooms allow you to group connected clients into separate channels or rooms. Clients can join or leave rooms based on their requirements or affiliations.

2. Targeted Messaging: Rooms enable you to send messages or events to a specific group of clients rather than broadcasting to all connected clients. This allows for targeted communication and reduces unnecessary network traffic.

3. Privacy and Security: By using rooms, you can enforce privacy and security measures by limiting message delivery to clients within specific rooms. Clients outside a room won't receive the messages intended for that room.

4. Scalability: Rooms provide a scalable way to handle large numbers of clients. You can distribute clients across different rooms based on factors such as interests, locations, or any other criteria that make sense for your application.

5. Flexibility: Socket.IO rooms are flexible and can be dynamically created, joined, or left by clients during their session. This allows for dynamic groupings and adaptability in your application's communication patterns.

6. Event-Based Communication: Socket.IO rooms work seamlessly with the event-driven communication model of Socket.IO. You can emit events to rooms on the server-side, and clients in the same room can listen for those events.

7. Room Management: Socket.IO provides methods for managing rooms on both the server-side and client-side. Clients can join or leave rooms, and the server can check room membership, broadcast messages to a specific room, or perform other room-related operations.

Overall, Socket.IO rooms enhance the organization, control, and efficiency of communication within your Socket.IO application. They allow you to group clients, send targeted messages, ensure privacy and security, and scale your application effectively.
